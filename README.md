FirebaseMessagingService and FirebaseInstanceIDService enable token refreshes and message handling
on the client.

## Getting Started

### Step 1

[Add firebase to your Android App](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup).

#### Note: After completion of step one, your project should have a google-services.json file added to the root of your project along with the classpath, plugin and dependecies.

#### Classpath

```
    classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:latest-version'
```

#### Plugin

```
    id 'com.google.gms.google-services'
```

#### Dependencies

no dependencies required

### Step 2

Add maven repository in project level build.gradle or in latest project setting.gradle file

```
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
```  

### Step 3

Add FunsolFCM dependencies in App level build.gradle.

```
    dependencies {
        implementation 'com.github.Funsol-Projects:FunsolTech-FCM:v1.0.2'
    }
```  

### Step 4

Finally intialize Firebase and setup FCM in application class or in your "MainActivity"

```
    FunsolFCM.setup(this, "YourTopicName")
```

### Remove

If you want to stop receiving notification from the subscribed topic simply call.

```
    FunsolFCM.removeSubscription("YourTopicName")
```
